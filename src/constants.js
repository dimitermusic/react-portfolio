export const ABOUT_TEXT = `Dimiter Yordanov is a Seattle-based composer and multi-instrumentalist whose work is featured by industry leaders like Netflix, Hulu, and Warner Chappell Production Music.

His credits include the SXSW-selected biopic 'You Cannot Kill David Arquette' and the documentary 'The Kindness Within', which won Best Documentary at the 2024 Beverly Hills Film Festival.

His style, often described as "peaceful, powerful, and heartfelt," blends intimate, emotional instrumentation with stirring cinematic themes.

For the Netflix docu-series 'The Kindness Diaries' (Seasons 1 & 2), Dimiter served as the sole composer, writing the theme and all original music, as well as performing every instrument and all vocals.

This artistic versatility, paired with his technical discipline as a Senior Software Engineer, defines his reliable and collaborative approach to every production.
